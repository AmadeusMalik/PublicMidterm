          Kenneth Bruce Gorelick, better known as “Kenny G”. Born June 5, 1956.
          He was in Seattle, Washington, and started playing the saxophone at
          only 10 years old. Before graduating from Ubiversity of Washington, he
          was a sideman for Barry White's <u>Love Unlimited Orchestra</u> while
          still in highschool. I was introduced to his music at a very young age
          from my parents. What made me want to choose him, is when I think of
          jazz, I think of a smooth saxophone, which is Kennys signature. I love
          the versatility that comes with a saxophone. Kenny just does something
          special when it comes to setting the tone with it. The first time I
          heard him I was maybe about 10 years old, through the quiet storm
          radio station. Kenny influenced many modern musicians like Kanye West
          and Usher.

          John Coltrane was one of Kennys influences in college. He also word
          with other famed musicians alike, such as Duke Elligton and Miles
          Davis. Some of his early influences were Count Basie And Lester Young.
          Besides the fact that they both play the saxophone, the smoothness in
          Kennys and Coltrane’s slower, softer songs. One song I’ve had in my
          personal playlist by John is ‘Lonnie’s Lament’. So, I was a little
          familiar with Coltrane before I knew he had major influence on Kenny.

          His second influence, Walter Theodore Rollins, better known as Sonny
          Rollins. Born on September 7th, 1930. Along with Coltrane, Kenny
          considers him a ‘jazz master’. I can find similarities in some songs
          when they use the saxophone to ‘talk’ even though there’s no lyrics. At 93 years old , Sonny sold his music catalog for 2 billion in the beginning of 2023.

          Another influence on Kenny was Stan Getz, full name; Stanley Gayetski.
          Born February 2nd, 1927, and died June 6th, 1991. Getz played a lot
          slower and played a bit more emotionally. Very close to Kennys songs
          now, that have a lot of emotion and don’t require lyrics to really
          convey how they’re feeling.
